# Covid-NetLogo
I used NetLogo platform and the HubNet extension to build two microworlds that could simulate the COVID-19 transmission risks. Both microworlds will simulate a group of students who go to school daily and continuously track the number of positive and negative cases. This project will be used to help audiences learn about the effectiveness of each safety measure that would help prevent the spread of the disease, such as wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, maintaining social distancing, and isolation. Based on the barrier of the basic statistic knowledge, the project would be presented in a high school classroom. Students could play with the value of each parameter and identify any interesting patterns or rules inside the model from their calculation and observation. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34287218/198729706-179bd5c6-9f28-47bf-91f3-c0e7ab4ef61e.png)
